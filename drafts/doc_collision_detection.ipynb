    "### Parametric ray\n",
    "\n",
    "A ray is represented parametrically as the set of all points $P + tV$ with $t \\in \\mathbb{R}$, where:\n",
    "\n",
    "* $P$ is an origin point\n",
    "* $V$ is a unit direction vector\n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore a ray is a infinite line in space. The ray can be 2D or 3D depending on the number of dimensions being simulated. The only change is to the dimension of P and V.\n",
    "\n",
    "Technically, the ray origin $P$ can be anywhere on the ray, and the $t$ value is arbitrary. In practice $P$ is often the surface collision point that creates the ray (in the case of a refraction or reflection), or the source position (if it comes from a light source).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Implicit surface\n",
    "\n",
    "A surface is defined in implicit form with a function: $F(X) = 0$. $X$ is either a 2D or 3D point depending on the number of dimensions being simulated. To clarify we use lower case $f$ for 2D, and upper case $F$ for 3D:\n",

    "* In 2D, $f(x,y) = 0$\n",
    "* In 3D, $F(x,y,z) = 0$\n",

    "\n",
    "* In 2D, $\\nabla f(x,y) = (\\frac{df}{dx}, \\frac{df}{dy})$\n",
    "* In 3D, $\\nabla F(x,y,z) = (\\frac{dF}{dx}, \\frac{dF}{dy}, \\frac{dF}{dz})$\n",

    "$F$ and $\\nabla F$ must be defined everywhere, not just on the surface or a region around the surface.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Sag functions\n",
    "\n",
    "As long as the above conditions are met, the meaning of the values of $F$ can be anything. It can be a proper sign distance function (SDF) like used in shader graphics, or a \"surface sag function\" as often used in optics, which is just the distance to the surface along the X axis. Given a \"sag function\" $x = s(y)$, the associated implicit function is $f(x,y) = s(y) - x$.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is only defined within the domain of the sag function, which is typically the diameter of a lens. Outside of that domain, another distance function must be used.\n",

    "\n",
    "A problem with the Newton's Raphson formulation above arises in cases where there is no root. For collision detection, it is necessary to detect the absence of collision to be able to know if rays should be refracted and sent to the next optical element in the stack, or dropped as \"non colliding\" rays. On top of collision points, we must also produce a mask indicating which ray do not collide with the surface.\n",

    "\n",

    "* [CircularPlane](/modeling/surfaces#circularplane): A circular planar surface (aka a disk)\n",
    "* [Sphere](/modeling/surfaces#sphere): with curvature parameterization\n",

    "* [Parabola](/modeling/surfaces#parabola): A parabola on the X axis $x = a r^2$\n",

    "More surface types coming soon, hopefully 😁 I also want to document how to add custom surfaces easily, as a lot of work as gone into that while designing the library. Basically any sag function $x = g(r)$ can be added, or even any implicit surface described by $F(x,y,z) = 0$, not necessarily axially symmetric.\n",

I'm happy to announce that Torch Lens Maker has received a grant from
[NLnet](https://nlnet.nl)! As part of the [NGI0 Commons
Fund](https://nlnet.nl/commonsfund), and with support from the European
Commission's [Next Generation Internet](https://ngi.eu) program.

**What this means in practice**

I will be working full-time on Torch Lens Maker for the first 6 months of 2026!
This does not mean that the financial future of Torch Lens Maker is 100%
secure, but it enables a strong commitment to the project and many more features ahead of us.

**What this grant enables**

During this time, development effort with be focused on the following areas:

* Improve optical modeling capabilities, in particular for historical imaging lenses designs
* Utilities to enable easy convertion of paraxial data into exact representation
* Expand tlmviewer capabilities in particular for sequential systems
* Support cemented lenses in the API
* Implement ray aiming
* Implement mechanical configuration sampling to enable modeling zoom lenses
* Reach 100% support for GPU optimization
* Improve jupyter notebook integration
* Improve the optimization API to support more advanced use cases
* Expand examples with more demo notebooks

**Introducing Torch Lens Maker development blog**

As part of this new grant I'm also creating this development blog. This will
help communication about the project, new releases, and other ideas!

You can [subscribe to the blog with RSS](https://victorpoughon.github.io/torchlensmaker/feed.rss).

Happy coding! 💻

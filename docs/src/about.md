## About me

Hello! My name is Victor, I'm the main author of this project. You can find
contact info on [my personal website](https://victorpoughon.fr). Feel free to
reach out, I love getting emails written by humans :)

## Sponsoring

I've been working on this project since 2024. First on my own time and money for
a few months, and now with support from [NLnet](https://nlnet.nl) for 2026. I'd
love to keep working on it as much as possible! If you want to contribute to
open-source optical modeling, please get in touch or make a donation! Thank
you 💚

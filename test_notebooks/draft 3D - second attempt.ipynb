    "### Rotational symmetry\n",
    "\n",
    "We want to create the corresponding 3D surface by rotation around the X axis. This means that the R axis from before, is now really the axis of the meridional plane. (A meridional plane is a plane that contains the optical axis X).\n",
    "\n",
    "So $r$ is the distance from the X axis to any point on the surface. In 3D, we have for any meridional plane $r = \\sqrt{y^2 + z^2}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "The definition of the 3D surface is that the intersection of every meridional plane with it is the 2D surface:\n",

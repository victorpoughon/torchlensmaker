    Vector based refraction (Snell's law).

    The 'critical_angle' argument specifies how incident rays beyond the
    critical angle are handled:

        * 'nan': Incident rays beyond the critical angle will refract
          as nan values. The returned tensor always has the same shape as the
          input tensors.

        * 'clamp': Incident rays beyond the critical angle all refract at 90Â°.
          The returned tensor always has the same shape as the input tensors.

        * 'drop' (default): Incident rays beyond the critical angle will not be
          refracted. The returned tensor doesn't necesarily have the same shape
          as the input tensors.

        * 'reflect': Incident rays beyond the critical angle are reflected. This
          is true physical behavior aka total internal reflection. The returned
          tensor always has the same shape as the input tensors.

    Args:
        rays: unit vectors of the incident rays, shape (N, 2/3)
        normals: unit vectors normal to the surface, shape (N, 2/3)
        n1: index of refraction of the incident medium, float or tensor of shape (N)
        n2: index of refraction of the refracted medium float or tensor of shape (N)
        critical_angle: one of 'nan', 'clamp', 'drop', 'reflect' (default: 'nan')

    Returns:
        unit vectors of the refracted rays, shape (C, 2)

               beyond the critical angle

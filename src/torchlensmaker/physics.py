    Vector based refraction (Snell's law).
    
    The 'critical_angle' argument specifies how incident rays beyond the
    critical angle are handled:
    
        * 'nan': Incident rays beyond the critical angle will refract
          as nan values. The returned tensor always has the same shape as the
          input tensors.

        * 'clamp': Incident rays beyond the critical angle all refract at 90Â°.
          The returned tensor always has the same shape as the input tensors.

        * 'drop' (default): Incident rays beyond the critical angle will not be
          refracted. The returned tensor doesn't necesarily have the same shape
          as the input tensors.

    Args:
        ray: unit vectors of the incident rays, shape (B, 2)
        normal: unit vectors normal to the surface, shape (B, 2)

        critical_angle: one of 'nan', 'clamp', 'drop' (default: 'nan')
